# Calculator

This project is a part of [The Odin Project course](https://www.theodinproject.com)

You can check out my project **[here](https://antonizarzycki.github.io/odin-calculator/)**

## Limitations

- Only supports one calculation at a time, e.g. "3\*5", doesn't support "3\*5\*6". The brackets are only used for negative numbers
